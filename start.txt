Yes, that's exactly right! When your SSL certificate expires after 3 months, you'll just need to:

Obtain new certificate files from your certificate provider.
Replace the existing certificate files in the /mnt/nvme/gablab_WD/flask_app/gablab_finance/gab-lab.at/ directory:

certificate.crt - Your new certificate
ca_bundle.crt - The new CA (Certificate Authority) bundle if provided
private.key - Your private key (this usually doesn't change)


Make sure the file permissions are correct:
bashsudo chmod 644 /mnt/nvme/gablab_WD/flask_app/gablab_finance/gab-lab.at/ca_bundle.crt
sudo chmod 644 /mnt/nvme/gablab_WD/flask_app/gablab_finance/gab-lab.at/certificate.crt
sudo chmod 600 /mnt/nvme/gablab_WD/flask_app/gablab_finance/gab-lab.at/private.key
sudo chown www-data:www-data /mnt/nvme/gablab_WD/flask_app/gablab_finance/gab-lab.at/ca_bundle.crt
sudo chown www-data:www-data /mnt/nvme/gablab_WD/flask_app/gablab_finance/gab-lab.at/certificate.crt
sudo chown www-data:www-data /mnt/nvme/gablab_WD/flask_app/gablab_finance/gab-lab.at/private.key

Restart Nginx to apply the changes:
bashsudo systemctl restart nginx


That's it! Your site will continue to work with the renewed certificate.
If you want to make this process more automated, you can consider using Let's Encrypt with certbot, which can automatically renew your certificates and update your Nginx configuration. But for now, manually replacing the files works perfectly fine.
Congratulations on getting your HTTPS server working successfully! ðŸŽ‰
